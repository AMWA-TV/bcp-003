# [Work In Progress] AMWA NMOS API Security Recommendations

This repository will be used to document best practice and recommendations, as produced by AMWA's API Security group.  
We are looking at confidentiality, identification, integrity, authentication
and authorisation for [AMWA NMOS APIs](https://amwa-tv.github.io/nmos).

A proposed approach is based on TLS 1.2, X.509 PKI, OAuth 2.0 and JSON Web Tokens.
