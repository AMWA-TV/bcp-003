## Scope

This document specifies how to implement automated provisioning of TLS Server Certificates to NMOS APIs.

This is based on best practice used for RESTful APIs, and is intended to promote a secure approach to interoperability.

Use of insecure communication (plain HTTP etc.) is forbidden within the scope of this document.

Implementation of [BCP-003-01](best-practice-secure-comms.md) is a recommended prerequisite to implementing this document.

Although security of web pages presented to users is also important, this is outside the scope of this document, which is concerned only with APIs.

## Use of Normative Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119][RFC-2119].

## Normative References

These appear at the end of the Markdown source for this document,
and are referenced as hyperlinks within the main body.

## Definitions

_See also the [NMOS Glossary](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos/wiki/Glossary), and definitions within RFCs._

### API

An HTTP / WebSocket API as defined in an AMWA NMOS Specification (IS-04, IS-05, IS-06, etc.)

### CSR (Certificate Signing Request)

The syntax used to request a TLS Certificate from a Certificate Authority, it contains the public key and identification information require by the Certificate Authority in the PKCS Format [RFC-2986][RFC-2986]

### EST Server

The entity that is providing the EST API in accordance with [RFC 7030][RFC-7030]

### EST Client

The entity that is using the EST API, for example:

- a Node requesting a TLS Server Certificate
- a Node requesting the latest Root CA of the domain

### NMOS Server

The entity that is providing an NMOS API, for example:

- a registry implementing IS-04 Registration and Query APIs
- a Node implementing IS-04 Node API and IS-05 Connection API

### NMOS Client

The entity that is using the NMOS API, for example:

- a Node using the IS-04 Registration API
- a monitoring application using the IS-04 Query API
- a connection control application using the IS-05 Connection API

## Introduction (informative)

This document covers the automated provisioning of TLS Server Certificates to NMOS Servers, which are then used to secure communications between NMOS Servers and NMOS Clients.

This document is not concerned with the security of the connection used to carry out provisioning of the TLS Server Certificate, but for the mechanism described in this document to be effective the connection must be secured, ideally using the recommendation covered in [BCP-003-01](best-practice-secure-comms.md).

## Automated Certificate Provisioning Flow (informative)

1. Before the NMOS Node(EST Client) is shipped from the factory it must be provisioned with a unique TLS Client Certificate, signed by the Manufacturers Certificate Authority
2. When the EST Client is connected to the target environments network, it will first discover the location of the EST Server using Unicast DNS-SD.
    * The EST Client should assume the EST server found using DNS-SD is trusted
3. The EST Client should then request the Root CA for the target network, from the EST Server
    * Using the Root CA returned to secure further communications with the EST Server and NMOS Servers
4. The EST Client must generate a Certificate Signing Request(CSR) for all supported TLS Cipher Suites with appropriate key lengths
    * Included in the CSR must be the DNS resolvable name for the current domain of the EST Client
    * Appropriate values for the remaining CSR fields SHOULD be used
5. The EST Client should send each CSR to the EST Server
    * The EST Client must provide the Manufacturer issued certificate during the TLS handshake, if valid
    * The EST Server will use the TLS Client Certificate to validate whether the EST Client is authorized to be issued with a TLS Server Certificate. If the EST CLient is validated the EST Server will return a signed TLS Server Certificate
6. The EST Client should provide the TLS Server Certificate and the corresponding chain of trust for all future HTTPS request to its NMOS APIs

The workflow if no valid Manufacturer TLS Client Certificate is present or if EST Client is moved to a new network are covered in detail in the following [sections](#est-client).

## DNS-SD Advertisement

The EST Server MUST be advertised using unicast DNS-SD as per [RFC 6763][RFC-6763].
The EST Server SHOULD NOT be advertised via mDNS-based DNS-SD.
EST Clients MUST not trust a mDNS-based DNS-SD advertisement for the EST server.
The Authorization Server MUST be advertised with the following service type:

```
_nmos-certs._tcp
```

The hostname and port of the EST Server MUST be identified via the DNS-SD advertisement, with the full HTTPS path then being resolved via the use of the path-prefix of `/.well-known/` as defined in [RFC5785][RFC-5785] and the registered name of `est`. Thus, a valid EST server URI path begins with `https://www.example.com/.well-known/est/`. A DNS A record MUST be provided to allow the hostname to be resolved.

Multiple DNS-SD advertisements for the same API are permitted where the API is exposed via multiple ports and/or protocols.

EST Clients MUST support discovering the EST Server through use of unicast DNS-SD service discovery, as described in [RFC 6763][RFC-6763].

### DNS-SD TXT Records

#### pri

The DNS-SD advertisement MUST include a TXT record with key 'pri' and an integer value. Servers MAY additionally present a matching priority via the DNS-SD SRV record 'priority' and 'weight' as defined in [RFC 2782][RFC-2782]. The TXT record should be used in favour of the SRV priority and weight where these values differ, in order to overcome issues in the Bonjour and Avahi implementations. Values 0 to 99 correspond to an active EST Server API (zero being the highest priority). Values 100+ are reserved for development work to avoid colliding with a live system.

#### arbLbl

The DNS-SD advertisement MAY include a TXT record with key 'arbLbl' and a string. The 'arbLbl' key defines an arbitrary label that if present MUST be appended to the well-know EST path, for example `https://www.example.com/.well-known/est/<arbitrary label>/`. The arbitrary label allows multiple EST Server instance on a single host to be used.

## EST Server Behaviour

### EST Server API

The EST Server SHALL present an instance of the EST API [RFC 7030][RFC-7030].

This MUST include the following API endpoints:

| Operation                       | Operation path  |
| ------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Distribution of CA Certificates | /cacerts        |
| Enrolment of Clients            | /simpleenroll   |
| Re-enrolment of Clients         | /simplereenroll |


### EST Server Authentication

The EST Server MUST present a valid TLS Server Certificate signed by the CA for realm from which it is issuing certificates.

### EST Server Client Authentication

The EST Server MUST authenticate the EST Client that is requesting a TLS Certificate manually or automatically using a TLS Client Certificate.

The EST Server MUST support using a TLS Client Certificate, presented during the TLS handshake by the EST Client to authenticate if the Client is trusted. The TLS Client Certificate can either be signed my the current CA or a trusted Root CA of the device manufacturer. The EST Server MUST provide a method to load multiple trusted Root CA's, that are used to verify TLS Client Certificate.

The EST Server MAY also support manually authentication of the EST Client if no TLS Client Certificate is presented during the TLS handshake, the TLS Client Certificate is not trusted or as an extra authentication step. The exact process for manual authentication will be implementation specific, but the EST Server MUST provide enough information to the user so they can authenticate the EST Client. During the manual authentication the EST Server MUST respond with either HTTP 202 or HTTP 503, the response must include a `Retry-After` header.

The EST Server MUST be capable of issuing TLS Certificates signed with both RSA and ECDSA keys.

The EST Server MUST return a TLS Certificate with the Extended Key Usage set for both TLS Server Authentication and TLS Client AUthentication as per [RFC 5280][RFC-5280]. This is to allow the TLS Certificate to be used to authenticated the NMOS APIs to client and for authentication of the EST Client during certificate renewal.

## EST Client

An EST Client SHOULD

An EST Client SHOULD allow EST to be disabled, preventing it from being automatically provisioned with a TLS Certificate if required by the networks security policy.

An EST Client SHOULD allow manual configuration of the EST Servers Hostname and Port, to prevent the EST Client from requesting a TLS Certificate from a rogue server.

An EST Client MUST provide a method to manually install both the Root CA and TLS Server certificate for the target environment, for the case when an EST Server is not present or the TLS Client Certificate is no longer valid.

If the EST Server returns a HTTP re-direct, the the EST Client SHOULD follow the re-direct URL.

If the EST Server returns an HTTP 4xx, HTTP 5xx or Connection Timeout, the EST Client SHOULD attempt the request again using an alternative EST Server if present, else the EST Client SHOULD wait an appropriate exponential backoff period before retrying.

### Initial Certificate Provisioning

**EST Server Discovery**

On connection to the target environments network the EST Client SHOULD attempt to discover the location of the EST Server, if EST has not been disabled or the location of the EST manually configured.

**Get Root CA**

The EST Client SHOULD make a HTTPS request to the `/cacerts` endpoint of the EST Server for the latest Root CA of the current network. The EST Client should explicitly trust the EST Server manually configured or discovered using Unicast DNS and not perform authentication of the EST Servers TLS Certificate during the initial request to EST Server. If EST Server returns a HTTP 200 response, the EST Client should use the returned Root CA to authenticate all further communication with the EST Server and NMOS APIs.

**Generate Certificate Signing(CSR) Request**

The EST Client SHOULD create a CSR for each Cipher Suite it supports with an appropriate Key Length. The CSR MUST contain a Common Name that is resolvable via DNS on the current domain.

**Certificate Request**

For each generated CSR the EST CLient SHOULD make a HTTPS request should be made to the `/simpleenroll` endpoint of the EST Server. The EST Client SHOULD include the manufacturer installed TLS Client Certificate if present and valid during the TLS handshake with the EST Server.

If the EST Server returns a HTTP 200 response the certificate request was successful and the EST Client should use the returned TLS Certificate and its chain of trust for all further requests to its NMOS APIs.

If the EST Server returns a HTTP 202 or HTTP 503 response, the request was successful, but the certificate has not been processed yet. The response SHOULD include a `Retry-After` header and the EST Client MUST wait the defined period before re-submitting the same request. The EST Client SHOULD attempt resending the request 5 time before aborting the certificate request and following the error condition.

If the EST Server returns any other the HTTP response, the request has been unsuccessful, this could be cause by a malformed request, server side error or the EST Client not being authorised. The EST Client SHOULD restart the EST workflow with an alternative EST Server if present, else the EST Client SHOULD wait an appropriate exponential backoff period before retrying.

### Certificate Renewal

At an appropriate point before the EST Clients TLS Certificate expires the EST Client SHOULD renew its TLS Certificate.

### Expired TLS Server Certificate

### Connection to new network

## TODO:
* Specification of returned TLS certificate format (eg, .p7, .pem)
* Specification of supported Cipher Suites and minimum key lengths
* Generate a new Key Pair for each TLS Certificate renewal
* Specification of Root CA rollover period and procedure
