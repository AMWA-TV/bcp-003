# AMWA NMOS API Security Recommendations

This repository is used to document best practice and recommendations,
as produced by AMWA's API Security group.
We are looking at confidentiality, identification, integrity, authentication
and authorization for [AMWA NMOS APIs](https://amwa-tv.github.io/nmos).

Our approach is based on TLS 1.2/1.3, X.509 PKI, OAuth 2.0 and JSON Web Tokens.
