# AMWA BCP-003 Security Recommendations for NMOS APIs

Security is an essential foundation of networked media workflows. For NMOS this means that APIs need to provide:

- *Confidentiality:* Data passing between client and the APIs is unreadable to third parties.
- *Identification:* The client can check whether the API it is interacting with is owned by a trusted party.
- *Integrity:* It must be clear if data travelling to or from the API been tampered with.
- *Authentication:* The client can check if packets actually came from the API it is interacting with, and vice versa.
- *Authorisation:* The API can determine whether the client interacting with it has authorisation to carry out the operation requested.

The BCP-003 set of recommendations help provide these features using widely adopted technologies used for the web:

- [BCP-003-01](https://specs.amwa.tv/bcp-003-01) recommends securing API communication using TLS 1.2 or better.
- [BCP-003-02](https://specs.amwa.tv/bcp-003-02) recommends using OAuth 2.0 authorisation using JWT, as per [IS-10](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-10).
- [BCP-003-03](https://specs.amwa.tv/bcp-003-03) recommends using Enrollment over Secure Transport for certificate provisioning.
